    "problem": "Prove that the number of ways to distribute n identical objects into k distinct boxes (allowing empty boxes) is equal to the number of ways to select (n + k - 1) objects taken k - 1 at a time. Formally, prove \\( C(n+k-1, k-1) = \\text{number of ways to distribute n identical objects into k distinct boxes} \\).",
    "solution": "1. **Understanding the Problem**: This combinatorial problem involves distributing 'n' identical objects (like balls) into 'k' distinct boxes (like bins). We allow some boxes to be empty. We will show that this distribution is equivalent to selecting certain numbers from a set. \n\n2. **Applying the Stars and Bars Theorem**: The Stars and Bars theorem states that if you want to put 'n' indistinguishable items into 'k' distinguishable boxes, the number of ways to do this can be computed using the formula: \n   \\[ C(n+k-1, k-1) \\]  \n   Here, the stars represent the objects, and the bars represent the dividers between different boxes. \n\n3. **Visualizing Stars and Bars**: Imagine 'n' stars in a row. To divide these stars into 'k' boxes, we need 'k-1' dividers or bars. Thus, we have a total of 'n + (k - 1)' positions (where 'n' are stars and 'k-1' are bars). The number of ways to arrange these 'n' stars and 'k-1' bars gives us the number of distributions. \n\n4. **Counting Arrangements**: The total arrangements will be a selection of '(n+k-1)' positions taken '(k-1)' at a time for the bars, resulting in the binomial coefficient:\n   \\[ C(n+k-1, k-1) = \\frac{(n+k-1)!}{n!(k-1)!} \\]  \n\n5. **Establishing Equality**: Therefore, we have shown that the number of ways to distribute 'n' identical objects into 'k' distinct boxes is given by the same formula as the number of ways to select (n + k - 1) objects taken k - 1 at a time, confirming that:  \n   \\[ C(n+k-1, k-1) = \\text{number of ways to distribute n identical objects into k distinct boxes} \\]  \n   This equality holds true due to the combinatorial interpretation through the stars and bars method. \n\n6. **Conclusion**: Hence, we conclude that indeed, \\( C(n + k - 1, k - 1) \\) counts the number of distributions of 'n' identical objects into 'k' distinct boxes, confirming our original statement. \n\n7. **Final Answer**: We have proved the required combinatorial identity: \\( C(n + k - 1, k - 1) \\) is the number of ways to distribute 'n' identical objects into 'k' distinct boxes allowing for empty boxes.",

The rate of change of V is given by:  \\n\\n   dV/dt = rate in - rate out  \\n   dV/dt = 5 - 0.1V  \\n\\nStep 2: Rearranging gives us a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):  \\n   dV/dt + 0.1V = 5  \\n\\nStep 3: We can solve this ODE using an integrating factor.

    "problem": "In a study involving the heights of adult males in a city, the heights are normally distributed with a mean of 70 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. A random sample of 30 males is selected. 1) What is the probability that the average height of this sample is greater than 71 inches? 2) What is the 95% confidence interval for the average height of the males in this city? 3) If another city has the same height distribution but with a mean of 72 inches, how does the average height of the males in this new city compare to the original city?",
    "solution": "1) To find the probability that the average height of the sample is greater than 71 inches, we first calculate the standard error (SE) of the sample mean: SE = \\( \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{30}} \\approx 0.5477 \\). Then, we find the z-score for 71 inches: \\( z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{SE} = \\frac{71 - 70}{0.5477} \\approx 1.82 \\). Using the standard normal distribution, we find the probability: P(Z > 1.82) = 1 - P(Z < 1.82) = 1 - 0.9656 = 0.0344. Thus, the probability that the average height of the sample is greater than 71 inches is approximately 0.0344 (or 3.44%).\n\n2) To find the 95% confidence interval for the average height, we use the critical value for a 95% confidence level (which, for a two-tailed test, is approximately 1.96 for a normal distribution). The confidence interval (CI) is given by: \\( \\bar{x} \\pm z* \\times SE = 70 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.5477 \\).

The characteristic equation is found by replacing \\(y\\), \\(y'\\), and \\(y''\\) with \\(r^2\\), \\(r\\), and 1 respectively. So, we have:\\n   $$r^2 + 3r + 2 = 0$$  \\n\\n 2. Next, we can factor this quadratic equation:\\n   $$(r + 1)(r + 2) = 0$$  \\n\\n 3. Setting each factor to zero gives us the roots:\\n   $$r + 1 = 0 \\Rightarrow r = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r + 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow r = -2$$  \\n\\n Therefore, the general solution to the differential equation is:\\n   $$y(t) = C_1 e^{-t} + C_2 e^{-2t}$$  \\n\\n Now, we need to find the constants \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\) using the initial conditions.\\n\\n4.

    "solution": "1. From clue 2, the Yellow house has 2 windows.\n2. From clue 4, since the White house has the most windows, it can be either 5 or 6 windows (because 6 is the highest and 5 would be the next). \n3. By clue 3, since the Green house has more than the Yellow house (2 windows) but fewer than the White house, it can only have 3 or 4 windows.\n4. From clue 1, since Red has more windows than Blue, we can infer that Red must have at least 3 windows (but that depends on the arrangement we create based on each clue). \n5. According to clue 5, if Blue has fewer windows than Green and more than Red, and since Purple can be either 3 or 4, Blue must have 3 windows and Red has 2 windows, which contradicts clue 2 (Red cannot have 2 windows). Therefore, Red must have 3 windows, Blue must have 4 windows, and Green can\u2019t have 4 windows since Blue is already taking that number. Thus, Green must have 5 windows.

This can be achieved using Stirling numbers of the second kind.\n2. Since the order of books in each box matters, we will multiply by the permutations of the books in each box.\n3. Finally, we will account for the distinct boxes.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of ways to partition 12 books into 4 non-empty subsets. We can use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted by S(n,k) where n is the total number of items (books) and k is the number of subsets (boxes). So we find S(12, 4).\n\nUsing known values, S(12, 4) = 162750. \n\nStep 2: Each grouping can have arrangements for books. Since the order matters in each box, we multiply the result from step 1 by the number of ways to arrange the 12 books. The number of arrangements of 12 books is 12! = 479001600.\n\nStep 3: Now account for the 4 distinct boxes. Since the boxes are distinct and each configuration of books could go into any of the boxes, we multiply by 4!, which accounts for the arrangement of the boxes themselves.\n\nCalculating the total:\nTotal Arrangements = S(12, 4) * 12! * 4!\nTotal Arrangements = 162750 * 479001600 * 24\n\nNow performing the final calculations:\nTotal Arrangements = 162750 * 479001600 = 77817661200000.\n\nNow, 77817661200000 * 24 = 1862762368000000.\n\nThus, the number of ways to pack the 12 unique books into 4 distinct boxes, where each box has at least one book and the order matters is 1862762368000000.",

Since x must be a whole number, the maximum value for x is 52. \n   - Thus, x = 52.\n\n6. Now substitute x back into the equation for y:\n   - y = x + 100 = 52 + 100 = 152\n\n7. Therefore, the company will produce:\n   - Type A (x) = 52 units\n   - Type B (y) = 152 units\n\n8. To find the total production cost when these quantities are produced:\n   - C_A = 3(52) + 50 = 156 + 50 = 206\n   - C_B = 5(152) + 30 = 760 + 30 = 790\n   - Total Cost = C_A + C_B = 206 + 790 = 996, which is under the $1000 budget.\n\nFinal results: The company will produce 52 units of Type A and 152 units of Type B while minimizing costs within the budget.",

    "problem": "A tank initially contains 100 liters of water. It is being filled with water at a rate of 3 liters per minute while simultaneously leaking at a rate proportional to the amount of water currently in the tank. The leakage is modeled by a differential equation stating that the rate of leakage is k * V, where V is the volume of water in the tank and k is the leakage constant (we'll take k = 0.1). What will be the volume of water in the tank after 20 minutes?",
    "solution": "To solve this problem, we first set up the differential equation that describes the volume V of water in the tank over time t:\n\n1. Rate of change of water in the tank:\n   dV/dt = rate in - rate out \n\n2. The rate in is constant at 3 liters per minute, and the rate out is the leakage rate k * V, where k = 0.1:\n   dV/dt = 3 - 0.1V \n\n3. This is a first-order linear differential equation. We can rearrange it to be:\n   dV/(3 - 0.1V) = dt \n\n4. Now we integrate both sides. The left side requires partial fraction decomposition (but here we just directly integrate):\n   Integral(dV / (3 - 0.1V)) = Integral(dt)\n\n5. The integral of the left side is:\n   -10 * ln|3 - 0.1V| \text{ (integrating gives a factor of -10 due to the 0.1 coefficient)}\n   For the right side, the integral of dt is simply t + C,\n   Therefore, -10 * ln|3 - 0.1V| = t + C.\n\n6. We solve for V:\n   |3 - 0.1V| = e^(-0.1t + C') where C' is the constant after exponentiation.\n   Solving for V gives us:\n   V(t) = (3 - e^(-0.1t + C')) / 0.1 \n\n7. We need to determine the constant C'. At t = 0, V(0) = 100:\n   100 = (3 - e^(C')) / 0.1\n   Therefore, 10 = (3 - e^(C'))\n   e^(C') = -7 -> C' will be some real number we can plug in when solving.\n\n8. We can equate the terms to solve for V, using the general formula:\n   V(t) = 30 + C * e^(-0.1t) where C = e^(C').\n\n9. Now calculate V(20):\n   V(20) = 30 + C * e^(-2) = 30 + C * 0.1353  (using e^(-2) ~ 0.1353).\n   At t=0, we know:\n   V(0) = 100 = 30 + C \rightarrow C = 70.\n\n10.

The only prime numbers less than 6 are 2, 3, and 5. \n\n2. **Identify the form**: Any integer can be expressed in one of six forms relative to 6: 6k, 6k+1, 6k+2, 6k+3, 6k+4, or 6k+5.

Again, we select 3 different grades out of the 5 grades available: \\( C(5, 3) = 10 \\) ways to select these grades. \n2. For each of the selected grades, we choose 1 student from each grade, just as in Part 1. Thus, for each selection of 3 grades, we again have the standardization of representation.  \n3. Therefore, we will have: \\( 10 \\text{ groups of 3 students each} \\).  \n\n### Part 3: Maximum Number of Groups from One Grade\n1. Assuming all 120 students belong to the same grade.\n2. The maximum groups of any size formed from a single grade is only limited by the number of students available per size.\n3. If they formed groups of 3 (the maximum under the same grade condition), it would be: \\( \\frac{120}{3} = 40 \\text{ groups} \\).  \n\n### Conclusion\n- **Groups of 4:** 5 groups\n- **Groups of 3:** 10 groups\n- **Maximum Groups from One Grade:** 40 groups\n",

    "problem": "A triangle has an angle A of 30 degrees and an angle B of 60 degrees. Find the length of side a opposite to angle A, given the side b opposite to angle B is 10 units long. Use the Law of Sines and then find the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.",
    "solution": "1. Identify the angles of the triangle: A = 30\u00b0, B = 60\u00b0, C = 90\u00b0 (since the angles in a triangle sum up to 180\u00b0).\\n2. Apply the Law of Sines: \\n   \\[ \\frac{a}{\\sin(A)} = \\frac{b}{\\sin(B)} = \\frac{c}{\\sin(C)} \\]  \\n   To find side a, rearrange to: \\n   \\[ a = b \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(A)}{\\sin(B)} \\] \\n3. Substituting values gives: \\n    \\[ a = 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(30\u00b0)}{\\sin(60\u00b0)} \\] \\n4. Since \\( \\sin(30\u00b0) = 0.5 \\) and \\( \\sin(60\u00b0) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\): \\n   \\[ a = 10 \\cdot \\frac{0.5}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = 10 \\cdot \\frac{0.5 \\cdot 2}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 5.77 \\text{ units} \\]  \\n5. Using Heron's formula to find the area: \\n   - First, calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):  \\n   \\[ s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\]  \\n   But we need side c. Using the Law of Sines again: \\n   \\[ c = 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(C)}{\\sin(B)} = 10 \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 11.55 \\text{ units} \\] \\n   Now we can find s: \\n   \\[ s = \\frac{5.77 + 10 + 11.55}{2} = 13.16 \\text{ units} \\] \\n6. Now calculate the area (A) using Heron's formula:\\n   \\[ A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \\] \\n   \\[ A = \\sqrt{13.16(13.16 - 5.77)(13.16 - 10)(13.16 - 11.55)} \\] \\n   \\[ A = \\sqrt{13.16 \\cdot 7.39 \\cdot 3.16 \\cdot 1.61} \\approx \\sqrt{320.93} \\approx 17.94 \\text{ square units} \\]",
    "final_answer": "The area of the triangle is approximately 17.94 square units.",
