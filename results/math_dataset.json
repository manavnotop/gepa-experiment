    "problem": "A park designer is planning to construct a new triangular flower garden within a rectangular park. The garden is going to be formed by connecting three points on the edges of the rectangular park, which has dimensions of 60 meters by 30 meters. One vertex of the triangular garden will be at the midpoint of one of the longer edges (the 60-meter side), and the other two vertices will be on the shorter edges (the 30-meter sides). The designer wants to ensure that the area of the triangular garden is at least 500 square meters. What is the maximum height of the triangle based on the given constraints?",
    "solution": "1. **Identify the Points of the Triangle:**  \n   - Let the rectangle's vertices be A(0, 0), B(60, 0), C(60, 30), and D(0, 30).  \n   - The midpoint of the longer side BC (60 meters) is at M(30, 0).  \n   - Let one vertex of the triangle be at M, which is (30, 0).  \n   - The other two vertices will be on the shorter edges, at points N(0, y) on edge AD and P(60, y) on edge BC, where y is the height at which these points are located.\n\n2. **Set Up the Area of the Triangle:**  \n   - The vertices of the triangle are M(30, 0), N(0, y), and P(60, y).  \n   - The area of triangle can be found using the formula:  \n     \\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\]  \n   - The base MN is 60 meters wide, as it stretches from (0, y) to (60, y), and the height is the vertical distance from the y-coordinate (y) to the base at M(30, 0), which is simply y.\n\n3. **Calculate the Area:**  \n   - Substituting into the area formula, we have:  \n     \\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60 \\times y = 30y \\]  \n   - We want the area to be at least 500 square meters:  \n     \\[ 30y \\geq 500 \\]  \n\n4. **Solve for y:**  \n   - Rearranging gives us:  \n     \\[ y \\geq \\frac{500}{30} = \\frac{50}{3} \\approx 16.67 \\text{ meters} \\]  \n\n5. **Finding the Maximum Height:**  \n   - The maximum height needs to respect the boundaries of the park. The maximum value for y can't exceed the height of the shorter edge (30 meters). Therefore, as long as 16.67 meters is less than 30 meters, it is a valid height.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**  \n   - Hence, the maximum permissible height of the triangle that's formed under these conditions is 30 meters, but given the constraints from the area requirement, the height we calculated where the triangle's area is satisfied is 16.67 meters, which is the practical limit.\n\nThus, the maximum height that keeps the area of the triangle above 500 square meters while adhering to the constraints of the rectangular park is approximately **16.67 meters** when vertices are located correctly on the respective edges of the park.",

    "solution": "1. **Identify the elements of the problem:**  \n   - Let the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) be represented as \\( K = \\frac{1}{2} \\times a \\times h_a \\), where \\( a \\) is the length of side \\( BC \\) and \\( h_a \\) is the height from vertex \\( A \\) to side \\( BC \\). \n  \n2. **Understanding the distances from Point P:**  \n   - Let \\( d_a \\) be the distance from point \\( P \\) to side \\( BC \\), \\( d_b \\) to side \\( CA \\), and \\( d_c \\) to side \\( AB \\).  \n   - By definition, the area of triangle \\( ABC \\) can also be expressed using point \\( P \\): \n     - Area from point \\( P \\) to side \\( BC \\):  \n       - Area1 = \\( \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d_a \\)  \n     - Area from point \\( P \\) to side \\( CA \\):  \n       - Area2 = \\( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d_b \\)  \n     - Area from point \\( P \\) to side \\( AB \\):  \n       - Area3 = \\( \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d_c \\)  \n  \n3. **Combining the areas:**  \n   - The total area of triangle \\( ABC \\) can be derived from the sum of these areas: \n   - \\( K = \frac{1}{2} a d_a + \frac{1}{2} b d_b + \frac{1}{2} c d_c \\)  \n  \n4. **Relating areas to distances:**  \n   - Rearranging yields:  \n     \\[ d_a + d_b + d_c = \\frac{2K}{a} + \\frac{2K}{b} + \\frac{2K}{c}  \\]  \n   \n5. **Multiplying and deriving height equivalence:**  \n   - If we take the common term among heights, \\( K = \\frac{1}{2} a h_a \\). \n   - Therefore, we can see that the sum of the perpendicular distances from point \\( P \\) should yield: \n     - \\[ d_a + d_b + d_c = h_a + h_b + h_c \\] \n   (where each height corresponds to the respective side opposite the vertex).  \n \n6. **Conclusion:**  \n   Thus we can deduce that the total distance from point \\( P \\) to the sides sums up to the height multiplied by the area per base side ratio, proving the required assertion that the sum of distances from a point inside the triangle to its sides relates directly to the heights derived from the vertices to those respective sides, effectively confirming the geometrical identity in a triangle.",

    "solution": "To solve this problem, we represent each friend's potential choices while considering the locations and restrictions.\n\nHere are the prime locations:\n1. 2: cave (smallest prime)\n2. 3: waterfall\n3. 5: hill\n4. 7: forest\n5. 11: old tree\n6. 13: underground tunnel\n\nNow let\u2019s analyze the restrictions:\n\n1. **Zoe will not search at the location labeled with the smallest prime number (2)**. She can choose from {3, 5, 7, 11, 13}.\n\n2. **Liam can only search at the cave (2) or waterfall (3)**. Thus, his options are severely limited only to locations 2 and 3.\n\n3. **Emma prefers the highest numbered location available after Zoe and Liam choose**. Therefore, Emma's choice depends directly on their selections.\n\n4. **Noah refuses to search at locations that are multiples of 3** (3, 6, 9,...).

Therefore, he can choose from {3, 5, 7, 11, 13}.\n\nLet\u2019s consider possible allocations and systematically work based on the restrictions:\n\n1. If Liam chooses cave (2), it gives Zoe the options {3, 5, 7, 11, 13}.\n   - Suppose Zoe picks 3 (waterfall); this means:\n     - Emma can now choose from {5, 7, 11, 13}, let's pick 13 for Emma. Now we have:\n       - Zoe: 3, Liam: 2, Emma: 13.\n       - Remaining for Noah: {5, 7, 11}. Noah cannot take 6 as it's a multiple of 3, so Noah takes 5.\n       - This leaves Ava with the only choice of 7.\n       - Oliver still has his choices, and he can pick 11. Thus, we could end with:\n         - Zoe: 3, Liam: 2, Emma: 13, Noah: 5, Ava: 7, Oliver: 11.\n\nHowever, following the selections, the constraints can lock us down, especially regarding Ava and the odd-numbered among the already locked down selections (13, if Emma takes it, limits Ollie\u2019s choices).\n\nProceed systematically with other routes considering Liam's limitation as well.\n\nIf Liam takes 3, Zoe can\u2019t, that will push choices.\nRepeat regarding Emma desires.\n\nThis process iterates over the combinations until suitable arrangements find themselves.\n\nAfter attempting combinations, I find:\n**Final assignments:  \nZoe at 5 => Noah at 7 => Emma at 11 => Ava at 3 => Liam at 2 => Oliver at 13.** Hence:\n- Zoe: 5  \n- Liam: 2  \n- Emma: 11  \n- Noah: 7  \n- Ava: 3  \n- Oliver: 13  \n\nThis satisfies all given restrictions. **Compatibility is met on extraction, ruling various lockouts. Thus validated, choices lay true, yielding a persistent loop** where all separate classification exists as per prime eliminations and chosen.\n\nThus, the distribution of locations is complete and solved correctly!",

For simplicity, we will use the given standard deviations to estimate our pooled standard deviation.\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate the t-statistic.\\n - Standard Error (SE) of the differences = sqrt((SD1^2 + SD2^2) / n) = sqrt((10^2 + 12^2) / 30) = sqrt((100 + 144) / 30) = sqrt(244 / 30) \u2248 2.39.\\n - Calculate t: t = D / SE = 5 / 2.39 \u2248 2.09.\\n\\nStep 5: Determine the degrees of freedom (df).\\n- For paired samples, df = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29.\\n\\nStep 6: Look up the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at alpha = 0.05 with df = 29.\\n- From the t-table, the critical t-value for df=29 at a significance level of 0.05 (two-tailed) is approximately \u00b12.045.\\n\\nStep 7: Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical t-value.\\n- Our calculated t = 2.09, which is greater than the critical t = 2.045.\\n\\nStep 8: Make a decision.\\n- Since the calculated t-statistic exceeds the critical t-value, we reject the null hypothesis.

    "solution": "To model the volume of water in the tank, let V(t) represent the volume of water in the tank at time t (in minutes). The rate of water entering the tank is a constant rate of 5 liters per minute. The rate of water leaving the tank is proportional to the volume of water currently in the tank, given by -0.1 V(t). Thus, we can set up the following differential equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\text{Rate in} - \\text{Rate out} = 5 - 0.1V(t) \\]\n\nThis gives us our first-order linear differential equation:\n\n\\[ \\frac{dV}{dt} + 0.1V = 5 \\]\n\nNext, we can solve this equation using an integrating factor.

According to the problem, the area of the garden itself is:  \n   \\[ L \\times W = 400 \\text{ square feet} \\]  \n\n2. The total length including the path will be (L + 2x) and the total width including the path will be (W + 2x). So, the total area, A, will be:  \n   \\[ A = (L + 2x)(W + 2x) \\]  \n   Expanding this gives:  \n   \\[ A = LW + 2Lx + 2Wx + 4x^2 \\]  \n   Substituting LW from the garden's area, we get:  \n   \\[ A = 400 + 2Lx + 2Wx + 4x^2 \\]  \n\n3.

However, there is a simpler realization that for maximizing area with a fixed inner area, the position and dimensions should be balanced.

Using the approach above allows us to check by edge cases, verifying against base givers or corner points in length aspects.  \n\nKnowing the area and sides adjust gives practicality to formulas that stabilize loss or optimization just in adjacent spaces.",

Specifically, parties 1 through 4 have chosen to participate, while parties 5 through 10 have opted out. However, the rules state that a maximum of 3 candidates can be selected from the participating parties, and at least one candidate must be selected from any participating party. How many different ways can a candidate selection committee of up to 3 candidates be formed from these 4 participating parties?",

We can select 1, 2, or 3 candidates from these 4 parties while ensuring that at least one candidate comes from any party selected. We will calculate the total number of ways to select candidates for each possible committee size (1, 2, and 3).  \n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to select 1 candidate.**  \nFor selecting 1 candidate from 4 parties, we can simply choose any of the 4 parties.  \nSo, the number of ways to select 1 candidate = C(4,1) = 4.  \n\n**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select 2 candidates.**  \nFor selecting 2 candidates from 4 parties, we can choose any 2 parties from the 4, and then we need to choose 1 candidate from each selected party.  \nThe number of ways to choose 2 parties from 4 is:  \nC(4,2) = 6.  \nFor each of these pairs of parties, we have 2 choices of candidates to select (1 from each party, say). Thus, for each selected pair, we have 2^2 = 4 ways to select the candidates.  \nHence, total ways for the selection of 2 candidates = C(4,2) * 2^2 = 6 * 4 = 24.  \n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to select 3 candidates.**  \nFor selecting 3 candidates from 4 parties, we can choose any 3 parties from the 4, and then we need to choose 1 candidate from each selected party.  \nThe number of ways to choose 3 parties from 4 is:  \nC(4,3) = 4.  \nFor each chosen set of 3 parties, we need to select 1 candidate from each party, giving us 2 for each party, which leads to total combinations of 2^3 = 8 ways.  \nThus, total ways for the selection of 3 candidates = C(4,3) * 2^3 = 4 * 8 = 32.  \n\n**Combining Results**  \nNow, we sum the numbers of ways from all candidate selections:  \nTotal ways = 4 (for 1 candidate) + 24 (for 2 candidates) + 32 (for 3 candidates) = 60.  \n\nThus, the total number of ways to select a candidate selection committee from the participating parties is 60.",

There are 6 vegetarian dishes and 4 non-vegetarian dishes. How many valid seating arrangements can the friends make under these conditions?",
    "solution": "To find the number of valid seating arrangements, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and combinatorial counting.\n\n1. **Identify Dishes**: We have 6 vegetarian (V) dishes and 4 non-vegetarian (N) dishes. We can represent friends by their dishes: V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6 (vegetarian) and N1, N2, N3, N4 (non-vegetarian).\n\n2. **Circular Arrangements**: The first step is to arrange the 10 friends in a circle, which normally would give us (n-1)! arrangements for n people. Here, since we have 10 friends, we start with 9! arrangements for a circular arrangement.\n\n3. **Segmenting Dishes**: Since we cannot have two friends with the same type of dish sitting next to each other, we will fix one group and arrange the others around them.

Once the vegetarians are seated, there are exactly 6 gaps (including one between the last and the first). We will choose 4 of these 6 gaps to place the non-vegetarians. The number of ways to choose 4 gaps from 6 is C(6,4). The non-vegetarians will then arrange themselves in those gaps, yielding 4! arrangements for them in the selected gaps.\n\n6. **Final Formula**: The total number of arrangements can be calculated as follows:\n   - Arranging vegetarians: 5!\n   - Choosing gaps for non-vegetarians: C(6, 4)\n   - Arranging non-vegetarians in selected gaps: 4!\n\nCombining these gives:\n   Total Arrangements = 5! * C(6, 4) * 4! \n\n   5! = 120 \n   C(6, 4) = 15 \n   4! = 24\n\nThus, Total Arrangements = 120 * 15 * 24 = 43200.",

Prove that the sides of the garden can be determined using the properties of similar triangles, and find the lengths of the sides of the triangular garden.",

The lighthouse can rotate its spotlight through an angle \u03b8 from the vertical, and the height of the lighthouse from the sea level is 20 meters.\\n\\nAt what distance from the lighthouse should the ship be positioned to maximize the angle at which the spotlight can shine on it (i.e., maximize the angle \u03b8)? Assume that the ship sails parallel to the coast at a distance h from the coastline, where h is constant. Define what h can be and determine the optimal distance from the lighthouse (D).",
    "solution": "To find the distance at which the ship should be positioned to maximize the angle \u03b8, we first need to relate the height of the lighthouse, the distance to the ship, and the angle \u03b8.\\n\\nLet\\n- h = the perpendicular distance from the ship's sailing path to the lighthouse (constant)\\n- D = the distance from the lighthouse to the point on the coast directly below the ship\\n\\nWe can visualize the situation as a right triangle. The height of the lighthouse (20 m) forms one leg, while D is the other leg touching the base of the lighthouse and the ship's path. The angle \u03b8 that the spotlight can shine on the ship is from both sides (left and right), forming two angles, each being an angle from the top of the lighthouse to the ship.\\n\\nUsing trigonometry, we know that: \\n\\n\\n  tan(\u03b8/2) = (20)/(D) \\n\\nand\\n\\n  tan(\u03b8/2) = (20)/(D) = y\\n  \u21d2 tan(\u03b8) = 2y/(1 - y^2)\\n\\nFrom the relationships: y = (20/D), where D is the distance directly under the ship. This gives us:\\n\\n\\n  tan(\u03b8) = 2*(20/D) / (1 - (400/D^2)) \\n\\n\\nTo maximize \u03b8, we can take the derivative with respect to D and set it to zero. However, it's more convenient to maximize the angle directly by finding D.\\n\\nLet's take the derivative of tan(\u03b8) with respect to D and set it to zero for finding critical points for optimization.\\n\\n1) We know that \\n   \\[D = \frac{20}{tan(\u03b8/2)}\\]\\n\\n2) To find the maximum angle \u03b8, note that its value decreases as D increases. Thus, we can set the distance D to a minimum which allows some geometry to stay intact.\\n   Considering trigonometric limits, the maximum \u03b8 corresponds to small D until it reaches an equilibrium threshold.  When D approaches zero, the angle approaches a maximum possible (\u03b8 approaching 90). . So we balance h. For reasonable minimum positioning, \\n   let\u2019s maximize D based on lighthouse height ratios from water level for h.\\n\\nFinal Calculation: A practical restriction should agree with the tangent properties and limits of D and angles against h height. Thus:\\n\\nTesting for a specific distance value via coast proximity yields optimum D from lighthouse to ship; we conclude that the max angle appears around 5m - 10m variance from lighthouse protractively (where D asymptotes 20/3 or so, producing viable angle threshold parameters). Thus ultimately for an effective practice, \\nD = 10m, allowing optimal \u03b8 efficiency spot directly at across sea level or trajectory.\\n\\nAlso securing that definite form of manageable D balances h height.\\n\\nFinal approximate assessment: Influencing particularly D being bounded by lighthouse height reflects true optimization angle level achievable at reasonable pertinently. Thus, D for this lighthouse must segment accordingly.\n\nOverall termed under properties of ratios, optimization plays upon the distance and height angles.\n\nLet's summarize:\n- The assumption gives  the best resultant at appropriate erect leading angles against h.\n- Thus D where the angle maximizes divergent reach is 10m reduction to coast for breakthrough.\n\nOverall workable dimension reveals positional ends and closest impact regions.\n\\nThe final confirmed value that causes reality or practical ship positioning relative to lighthouse can yield D = 10 m dropping assure relative conservative measures upon deploying angles effectiveness to maximize nautical appearances within restraint of 20m-30m negligible conflicts potentially.\n",

    "solution": "Step 1: Calculate total tickets purchased by the friends.  \n- Friends buying 2 tickets each: 5 friends \u00d7 2 tickets = 10 tickets  \n- Friends buying 3 tickets each: 3 friends \u00d7 3 tickets = 9 tickets  \n\nTotal tickets = 10 + 9 = 19 tickets.  \n\nStep 2: Check if the total number of tickets (19) is even or odd.  \n- 19 is odd. Since the total needs to be an even number (according to problem statement), we add tickets to make it even.  \n\nStep 3: To make 19 an even number, we need to add 1 ticket (19 + 1 = 20).  \n\nStep 4: Now, check if the total (20) is a multiple of 4.  \n- 20 \u00f7 4 = 5.

This proves that any vector \\(P = (x, y)\\) can indeed be expressed as a linear combination of \\(P_1\\) and \\(P_2\\) since we have explicitly found \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) for any values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \n\nThus, we have shown that the vector space consisting of points on a 2D map expressed by vectors can represent any point using the given vectors, confirming the adaptability and reach of linear combinations in linear algebra, especially in practical contexts of representation.",

    "problem": "In a small town, the residents have a tradition to celebrate their community every 4 years, and they decided to create a special monument. To fund the construction of the monument, each of the town's 375 families pledged a certain amount of money.

After the first pledge collection, the total amount raised was $80,200. However, during the counting, they noticed that the amount could be represented as a sum of several consecutive prime numbers starting from 2. How many of these consecutive prime numbers can be found that sum up to an amount less than or equal to $80,200?",
