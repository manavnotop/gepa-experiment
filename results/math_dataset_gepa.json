    "problem": "A small tech startup, \"InnoTech\", is preparing to launch a new app. They have conducted a focus group consisting of 100 individuals to assess user preference among three app design variants: A, B, and C. Based on the feedback, 45% preferred Design A, 30% preferred Design B, and the remaining participants (25%) preferred Design C. As they prepare for launch, InnoTech plans to randomly select 10 beta testers from the focus group to evaluate the app designs. What is the probability that exactly 5 beta testers will prefer Design A, while the other 5 will prefer Designs B and C combined?",
    "solution": "To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula since we are looking at the number of successes (individuals preferring Design A) in a fixed number of trials (the beta testers selected). The binomial probability can be calculated using the formula:\n\nP(X = k) = (n choose k) * (p^k) * (q^(n-k))\n\nWhere:\n- n = total number of trials\n- k = number of successes (preferring Design A)\n- p = probability of success (preferring Design A)\n- q = probability of failure (not preferring Design A)\n\nIn this case:\n- n = 10 (total number of selected beta testers)\n- k = 5 (those preferring Design A)\n- p = 0.45 (probability of preferring Design A)\n- q = 1 - p = 0.55 (probability of not preferring Design A)\n\nNow, let's calculate:\n1. Calculate the number of ways to choose k successes in n trials:\n\\( n \\choose k = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} = \\frac{10!}{5!5!} = 252 \\)\n\n2. Calculate the probability of exactly 5 testers preferring Design A:\n\\( P(X = 5) = 252 * (0.45^5) * (0.55^5) \\)\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 0.45^5 \\):  \n\\( 0.45^5 = 0.045576 \\)\n\nThen, calculate \\( 0.55^5 \\):  \n\\( 0.55^5 = 0.0503284375 \\)\n\nNow we plug these values into the probability expression:\n\\( P(X = 5) = 252 * 0.045576 * 0.0503284375 \\)\n\\( = 252 * 0.002295 \\\n\u2248 0.578 \\)\n\n3.

    "problem": "A tower stands on a hillside at an angle of elevation of 30 degrees from a point located 100 meters down the slope from the base of the tower. The hillside itself also rises at a constant angle of 15 degrees to the horizontal. Determine the height of the tower above the base of the hill.",
    "solution": "1. **Visualize the problem**: We have a right triangle where the tower height (h) forms one leg, and the horizontal distance from the point down the slope to the base of the tower forms the other leg. The slope of the hill creates another triangle in which the angle of elevation to the tower from the point is 30 degrees, and the slope rises at 15 degrees. \n\n2. **Calculate the effective horizontal distance (d)**: \n   - The distance from the point down the slope to the base of the tower (100 meters) can be broken down using the angle of the slope: \n   - The horizontal component (d) can be found by: \n     \\[ d = 100 \\cdot \\cos(15^{\\circ}) \\approx 100 \\cdot 0.9659 \\approx 96.59 \\text{ meters} \\] \n\n3. **Set up the equation for the height of the tower (h)**: \n   - Using the 30 degree angle of elevation from the calculated horizontal distance (d) to find the height (h): \n   - By the definition of tangent in trigonometry: \n     \\[ \\tan(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{h}{d} \\] \n   - So, rearranging gives us: \n     \\[ h = d \\cdot \\tan(30^{\\circ}) \\approx 96.59 \\cdot 0.5774 \\approx 55.8 \\text{ meters} \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Add the height of the hill (the vertical height component can be found using the angle of the hillside) to the height of the tower we measured from the point downhill.\n   - The height of the base of the hill from the point is ignored for this problem as per the height from point of view. Hence for practical purposes, we denote height of the tower above the base of the hill as well resulting height being approximately that of the derived height from applying the 30-degree elevation from the ground slope.",

The company knows they can increase their machine counts based on demand. Prove that the highest number of machines they can use without exceeding their production limits is when they utilize the condition x + y = 5. Show that this proves the machines can only be combined to produce a maximum of 5 products in a feasible solution to this linear combination.",
    "solution": "To prove the maximum number of machines while satisfying both conditions, we need to analyze the system of equations given by the two constraints:\n\n1. From the production equation: 2x + 3y = 12 (Equation 1)\n2. From the maximum machine usage condition: x + y = 5 (Equation 2)\n\nNow, we can isolate one variable from Equation 2 and substitute it into Equation 1. Let\u2019s solve for y in terms of x from Equation 2:\n\ny = 5 - x\n\nNow, substitute y in Equation 1:\n\n2x + 3(5 - x) = 12\nSimplifying this gives:\n2x + 15 - 3x = 12\nCombine like terms:\n- x + 15 = 12\nNow isolate x:\n-x = 12 - 15\n-x = -3 -> x = 3\n\nWith x found, substitute back to find y:\n\ny = 5 - 3 = 2\n\nThus, we have one combination: (x, y) = (3, 2). Now let\u2019s check if there are any other combinations.\n\nLet's consider the first equation and see how it behaves:\nIf we try to fulfill the machine limit of x + y = 5 exactly:\n- If x = 0, y = 5: then 2(0) + 3(5) = 15 (not feasible)\n- If x = 1, y = 4: then 2(1)+3(4) = 14 (not feasible)\n- If x = 2, y = 3: then 2(2)+3(3) = 9 (also not feasible)\n- If x = 3, y = 2: then 2(3)+3(2) = 12 (feasible)\n- If x = 4, y = 1: then 2(4)+3(1) = 11 (not feasible)\n- If x = 5, y = 0: then 2(5)+3(0) = 10 (not feasible)\n\nThus, the only feasible production combination is (x, y) = (3, 2). This reaches the constraint of Equation 1 exactly and does not exceed the maximum machine limit stated by Equation 2. Since further increases in either x or y lead to an infeasible solution regarding the production limits, we conclude that the maximum number of machines while satisfying both equations can only be capped at their specified limits on machine usage. \n\nHence, the highest number of machines (x + y) used remains = 5, which proves the requirement that machines can be combined without exceeding production limits is 5.",

Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula: \\( 48 = 2((w + 4) + w) \\) \n\n4.

    "solution": "1. **Area of the Hexagon**: The area (A) of a regular hexagon can be calculated using the formula:   \n   A = (3\u221a3 / 2) * s\u00b2, where s is the length of a side.  \n   Here, s = 10 m.  \n   A = (3\u221a3 / 2) * (10)\u00b2  \n   = 150\u221a3 m\u00b2.  \n   \n2. **Calculating the Radius of the Circular Garden**:  \n   The distance from the center of the hexagon to the midpoint of any side is given by the formula:   \n   r = (s\u221a3) / 2.  \n   Substituting s = 10 m,  \n   r = (10\u221a3) / 2 = 5\u221a3 m.  \n   There is a 2-meter width restriction on the closest edge of the hexagon to the center of the circular garden. Therefore, the radius of the circular garden (R) would be:  \n   R = (5\u221a3 - 2) m.  \n   To find this explicitly:  \n   R = 5 * 1.732 - 2 = 8.66 - 2 = 6.66 m.  \n   Thus, R = 6.66 m is the radius of the circular garden.  \n   \n3. **Area of the Circular Garden**: The area (Ag) of a circle is given by the formula:   \n   Ag = \u03c0R\u00b2.  \n   Ag = \u03c0(6.66)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * 44.3556 \u2248 139.83 m\u00b2.  \n   \n4. **Calculating Remaining Area of the Pavilion**:  \n   Remaining area (Ar) = Area of hexagon - Area of garden:  \n   Ar = 150\u221a3 - Ag \u2248 150 * 1.732 - 139.83 \u2248 259.80 - 139.83 = 119.97 m\u00b2.  \n   \nThus, the radius of the largest circular garden is approximately 6.66 m, and the total area available for the pavilion after subtracting the garden area is approximately 119.97 m\u00b2.",

Prove that the area of the smaller triangular garden is exactly one-quarter the area of the larger triangular garden. Use geometric principles and algebra to support your proof.",
    "solution": "1. Calculate the area of the larger triangular garden using the formula for the area of a triangle:  \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\).  \n   For the larger garden (base = 12 m, height = 5 m):  \n   \\[ \\text{Area}_{\\text{larger}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 \\times 5 = 30 \\text{ m}^2. \\]  \n\n2. Determine the height of the smaller triangular garden:  \n   The problem states that the height of the smaller garden is two-thirds of the height of the larger garden, so:  \n   \\[ \\text{Height}_{\\text{smaller}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 5 = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ m}. \\]  \n\n3. The base of the smaller triangular garden will remain proportional to the base of the larger garden since they are similar triangles. The areas of similar triangles are proportional to the square of their corresponding side lengths. In this case, since we only know the height, we find the factor of similarity first:  \n   Ratio of heights = \\( \\frac{\\text{Height}_{\\text{smaller}}}{\\text{Height}_{\\text{larger}}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3}}{5} = \\frac{2}{3}. \\)  \n\n4. The area of similar triangles is proportional to the square of the ratio of their heights, so:  \n   \\[ \\text{Area ratio} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9}. \\]  \n   Therefore, the area of the smaller triangular garden is:  \n   \\[ \\text{Area}_{\\text{smaller}} = \\text{Area}_{\\text{larger}} \\times \\frac{4}{9} = 30 \\times \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{120}{9} = \\frac{40}{3} \\text{ m}^2. \\]  \n\n5. We now need to confirm that this area is exactly one-quarter of the area of the larger garden:  \n   Calculate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\text{Area}_{\\text{larger}} \\):  \n   \\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 30 = 7.5 \\text{ m}^2. \\]  \n\n6.

The height conforms it shows the respective architecture designed as sustainable.\nThis models geometric proportion as areas appropriately. \\]",

The company operates in a region where the fixed cost for each truck is $500 per day, and the variable cost is $2 per mile driven. On average, each truck can cover 200 miles per day and deliver products worth $3000. However, due to demand fluctuations, the revenue generated per truck can be modeled as R(x) = 3000 - 10x, where x is the number of trucks used. Determine how many trucks the company should use to maximize their profit.",
    "solution": "1. First, we identify the profit function, which is the revenue minus the costs. The total cost C(x) for x trucks is the fixed cost plus variable costs per mile driven:\n   C(x) = 500x + 2 * (200 miles) * x = 500x + 400x = 900x.\n\n2. Next, the revenue function R(x) provided is:\n   R(x) = 3000 - 10x.\n\n3. The profit function P(x) is therefore:\n   P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = (3000 - 10x) - (900x) = 3000 - 910x.\n\n4. To find the maximum profit, we can take the derivative of P(x) with respect to x and set it equal to zero:\n   P'(x) = -910.\n\n5. Since this derivative is a negative constant, it means the profit function is a decreasing linear function. Therefore, the company should minimize the amount of trucks they use.\n\n6. To ensure they still operate efficiently, we need to evaluate the situation when they use a minimal number of trucks or at the point where demand shifts occur.\n\n7. Since R(x) also defines revenue, we can find the break-even point by setting R(x) = C(x) and determining for different number of trucks:\n   3000 - 10x = 900x,\n   3000 = 910x,\n   x = 3000/910 = 3.29. \n\nSince x must be a whole number, evaluate using either 3 or 4 trucks for profit maximization. \n\n8.

We can summarize the maximum points for items and evaluate the combination count.\n\nIn total, we can calculate these combinations systematically and yield a maximum point of 14 as the score for 100 recyclable items that can form through 100 from the prime combinations of 2 and 5, yielding different counts of items that can lead to similar points. \n\nTaking the unique combinations as items determining must yield the number of pairwise contiguous outcomes satisfying the maximum points. Count unique partitions for maximum distribution from prime pairs for final combinations.\n\nThus the possible item distributions leading to the maximum points are evaluated. We observe there are multiple combinations as outputs lead back to the factorization properties of 100.\nFinal calculated unique items as per factorization lead to at least 12 combinations representing maximum scores derived from distinct count-based analysis.",

    "problem": "A team of six friends, Alex, Bob, Charlie, Dana, Eva, and Frank, decide to form two groups for a fun trivia game night. Each team will consist of three players. They want to ensure that no matter how they arrange the teams, Alex and Bob will always be in the same team. How many unique ways can the team be divided into two groups of three players each while keeping Alex and Bob together?",
    "solution": "1. Since Alex and Bob must always be together, we can consider them as a single unit or block. This means we essentially have 5 units to arrange: {Alex & Bob, Charlie, Dana, Eva, Frank}.\\n\\n2. From these 5 units, we need to select 2 additional members to join the Alex-Bob block (which we consider as one entity) to form one team of 3.\\n\\n3. The number of ways to choose 2 additional members from the remaining 3 friends (Charlie, Dana, Eva, Frank) is given by the combination formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of items to choose from and \\( k \\) is the number of items to choose. In this case, \\( n = 4 \\) and \\( k = 2 \\).\\n\\n4. We calculate \\( C(4, 2) \\):  \\n   \\[ C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6 \\]  \\nThus, there are 6 different combinations of members who can join Alex and Bob.\\n\\n5. Therefore, the remaining 3 members automatically form the other team, hence each selection gives a unique arrangement, thus there are 6 ways to divide the team into two groups of 3, satisfying all conditions.\\n\\n6. Additionally, since grouping does not regard order (i.e., Team 1 vs Team 2), we consider each division into teams as a single decision and do not need to count reversed teams separately.",
