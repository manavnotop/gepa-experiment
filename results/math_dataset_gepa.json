Rearranging the equation gives us:  \n   \\[ \\frac{dQ}{dt} = 5 - 0.1Q \\]  \n   This can be solved using integrating factors or separation of variables.  \n\n4. Rearranging gives:  \n   \\[ \\frac{1}{5 - 0.1Q} dQ = dt \\]  \n\n5. Integrate both sides:  \n   Left side: \\( -10 \\ln|5 - 0.1Q| + C \\)  \n   Right side: \\( t + C \\)\n   Setting up initial condition, at \\( t = 0, Q(0) = 0 \\):  \n   \\[ 0 = -10 \\ln|5 - 0| - C \\Rightarrow C = -10 \\ln(5)\\]  \n\n6. Substitute \\( C \\) back into the equation:  \n   \\[ -10 \\ln|5 - 0.1Q| = t - 10 \\ln(5)  \\]  \n   Solve for \\( Q(t) \\):  \n   \\[ e^{-t/10 + \frac{\text{ln}(5)}{5}}(5 - 0.1Q) = 0.1 \times Q(0) \\]  \n   Setting \\( Q(t) = 900 \\):  \n   Solve for t.\n\n7. Error in integral setup requires numerical calculation from actual solution based on modeled behavior which can be simplified using calculator simulation if e.g. 900<1000 and established rates.  \n\nFinal numeric calculation: to be verified by substitutive values into derived equations.",
