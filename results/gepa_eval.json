    "feedback": "The reasoning is clear and correct, effectively showing the powers of 3 modulo 10, identifying the necessary condition for divisibility by 10, and correctly summing the values of n. However, the structural flow could improve; explicitly stating assumptions about the range of n or clarifying the choice of limits would enhance readability. The final answer is accurate, and overall the solution is well-articulated."

    "feedback": "The solution effectively uses the Law of Sines to determine the length of side b in triangle ABC. Each step is logically presented, and the mathematical manipulations are clear and mostly correct. The only minor issue is a slight lack of clarity in the transitions between algebraic steps, which could be improved for better readability. However, the final answer is accurate and well-formatted, demonstrating a solid understanding of the problem. Overall, this is a strong response with a minor area for improvement in step clarity."

    "feedback": "The solution shows a reasonable application of the Gaussian elimination method but has notable inaccuracies in calculations and clarity. The initial setup and the progression through row operations are mostly clear, but the arithmetic steps especially in substituting values back are incorrect, leading to false values for x, y, and z. There are also some minor formatting issues, such as missing correct alignment of equations. A more careful review of calculations and better clarity in the steps would improve the overall accuracy and readability."

    "feedback": "The solution shows a good structure and flow, making it easy to follow the elimination method. However, there are inaccuracies in the calculations leading to incorrect approximations of the values of x and y, as well as a rounding error that affects correctness. The reasoning behind the elimination was clear, but it could have detailed intermediate steps in checking the solution or confirming the final values. Additionally, considering how to format the equations for clarity would also enhance the readability."

    "feedback": "The solution is well-structured and follows a clear step-by-step approach to calculate the probability of selecting a red ball. The reasoning is strong, as it sufficiently covers the calculation process, including the identification of total and favorable outcomes. However, the final answer is presented in decimal form (0.6) rather than the fraction 3/5, which is traditionally used in probability problems. This discrepancy may confuse readers who expect the final answer to align with the earlier calculations. Overall, the solution is correct and informative but could be improved by including the final probability in its fraction form."
